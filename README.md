Final Project Review: Coderina Team Management Dashboard
Date: July 5, 2025
Status: Core Feature Development Complete

1. Project Summary
This project successfully delivered a comprehensive, web-based dashboard to manage team registrations for Coderina's various competitions. The platform provides distinct, secure portals for both Coderina administrators and team coaches/leaders, streamlining the entire lifecycle from registration and document submission to review and approval.

2. Implemented Features
The following features, as outlined in our project plan, are now live and functional in the application:

Admin-Specific Features
Full Admin Dashboard: A central hub for Coderina staff with at-a-glance statistics on team registrations.

Team Management & Approval: Admins can view a filterable list of all registered teams, inspect their details (including uploaded documents), and approve or reject their applications.

Competition & Rules Engine: A dedicated tab allows admins to create, edit, and delete competitions, defining the specific rules for team composition (min/max students and coaches) for each.

Event Management: Admins can create and manage a timeline of events (e.g., "Regional Qualifiers," "Submission Deadlines") and associate them with specific competitions.

Visual Analytics: An "Analytics" tab provides charts and graphs for data-driven insights, including a breakdown of teams by state and by competition.

Data Export: Admins can export filtered lists of teams to a CSV file for offline reporting and analysis.

Coach & Team Leader Features
Secure Authentication: A full sign-up and login system allows coaches to create and access their own secure accounts.

Personalized Dashboard: Upon logging in, coaches see a dashboard tailored to them, showing only the teams they have registered and a list of upcoming events relevant to their competitions.

Multi-Step Registration Form: An intuitive, step-by-step form guides coaches through the process of registering a new team.

Team Cloning: To simplify re-registration for new seasons, coaches can clone an existing team, which pre-populates the registration form with the previous year's data.

Comprehensive Team Management: For each team, coaches have a dedicated "Manage" page where they can:

Upload Documents: Submit required files like consent forms directly to Firebase Storage.

Manage Documents: Delete incorrectly uploaded files.

Edit Team Details: Modify team information and resubmit for approval if their status is "Pending" or "Rejected".

Edit Roster: Add or remove individual members from their team roster for non-approved teams.

System-Wide Features
Role-Based Access: The platform strictly separates what admins and coaches can see and do, ensuring data privacy and security.

Dynamic Rule Enforcement: All forms that involve team composition (registration, roster editing) automatically enforce the rules defined by the admin for that competition.

Real-time Updates: The application uses live listeners to Firestore, meaning all data displayed is up-to-date without needing to refresh the page.

Error Handling: The system now includes a helpful overlay to guide admins on setting up Firestore Security Rules if a permission error is detected.

Notifications (Ready for Deployment): The backend Firebase Function for automatically emailing coaches upon team approval or rejection is complete and ready for deployment.

3. Project Status
The Coderina Team Management Dashboard is feature-complete based on our development plan. All core functionalities and key enhancements are implemented and integrated.

The platform is robust, secure, and provides a polished, professional experience for all user roles. The final step before a full-scale launch would be the deployment of the coderina_notification_function to a Firebase "Blaze" plan project to enable the automated emails.

This concludes our development and refinement phase. The platform is now ready for user acceptance testing and deployment.
